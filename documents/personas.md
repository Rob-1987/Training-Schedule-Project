Demographics
•	Name: Jason
•	Age: 35
•	Location: Auckland, New Zealand
•	Occupation: Checkout operator at Woolworths (2pm - 10pm shift)
Current Lifestyle Challenges
Diet & Nutrition Jason struggles with excessive sugar consumption and has a preference for fast food. His late work shift (ending at 10pm) likely contributes to convenience-based eating habits and makes meal planning more challenging.
Physical Activity He's currently dealing with low fitness levels and spends considerable time gaming, which contributes to a sedentary lifestyle. The combination of a standing job at checkout and evening work hours may leave him feeling too tired for exercise.
Daily Routine Working afternoon-to-evening shifts creates unique scheduling challenges. His free time is primarily in the mornings and late nights, which can disrupt typical meal patterns and make it harder to establish consistent healthy routines.
Goals & Motivation
Primary Goal: Weight loss and improved fitness
Key Motivator: His upcoming wedding - Jason wants to look and feel healthy on his wedding day. This is a powerful, time-bound goal that provides clear motivation for lifestyle changes.
Barriers to Success
•	Late work schedule disrupting normal meal times
•	Established habits around gaming and fast food
•	Sugar dependency that may require gradual reduction
•	Limited time and energy after long standing shifts
•	Easy access to convenient but unhealthy food options
Opportunities for Growth
•	Strong emotional motivator (wedding day)
•	Specific goal provides clear target
•	Morning availability for meal prep or exercise
•	Young enough to see relatively quick fitness improvements
•	Stable employment provides routine structure to build habits around
This persona represents someone at a turning point, ready to make changes but facing real practical obstacles that need strategic solutions rather than one-size-fits-all advice.
